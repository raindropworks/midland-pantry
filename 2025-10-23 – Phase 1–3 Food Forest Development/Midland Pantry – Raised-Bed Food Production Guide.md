# MIDLAND PANTRY & COMMUNITY FOOD FOREST INITIATIVE

## Raised-Bed Food Production Guide (Phases 1–3)

**Version 1.0 · October 24 2025**  
*Pantry Planning Project*

### SUMMARY

This guide provides baseline design, maintenance, and planting recommendations for raised-bed food-production systems within the Midland Pantry & Community Food Forest.  
It supports Jaide Crow’s and Heather-Lynne Van Wilde’s coordination of volunteer and crop-rotation planning.¹

### DESIGN PRINCIPLES

- Beds should not exceed **4 ft width** for wheelchair and reach accessibility.
- Height range: **18–30 inches** depending on volunteer mobility.
- Frame materials: untreated cedar, recycled HDPE, or galvanized steel.
- Soil blend: 40 % topsoil / 40 % compost / 20 % aeration material (perlite or coarse sand).
- Each bed receives independent irrigation from gravity-fed or timed drip systems.

### PHASE 1 – INSTALLATION & FOUNDATION

- Mark bed positions to align with sun exposure and existing habitat zones.
- Double-dig soil below frames for drainage improvement.
- Construct wheelchair-accessible pathways (min 36 in width).
- Add mulch borders and signage for future volunteers.

### PHASE 2 – CULTIVATION & ROTATION

- Implement **succession planting** (leafy greens → roots → nitrogen fixers).
- Record yields per bed and compare growth rates.
- Maintain soil health by adding compost each rotation cycle.
- Assign bed numbers for data tracking in Heather’s archive.
- Encourage companion-planting pairs (tomato + basil, carrot + leek).

### PHASE 3 – MAINTENANCE & COMMUNITY EDUCATION

- Train volunteers in soil testing, pest management, and compost use.
- Integrate raised-bed maintenance with food-forest and pantry operations.
- Use signage and QR codes linking to online planting guides.
- Host seasonal workshops and community harvest days.

### ACCESSIBILITY NOTES

- Maintain clear 36-inch paths and tactile edge indicators.
- Provide ergonomic hand tools and adaptive grip handles.
- Use raised-bed labeling with large-print or Braille tags.

### FOOTNOTE

¹ **Site layout pending:** Official property layout and utility plans have not yet been obtained. Current design elements reflect estimated placements based on observed site conditions. Final diagrams and measurements will be added upon receipt of verified site plans.
