# MIDLAND PANTRY & COMMUNITY FOOD FOREST INITIATIVE

## Full Grant Proposal

**Version 1.0 · October 24 2025**  
*Pantry Planning Project*

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Midland Pantry & Community Food Forest initiative seeks to create an accessible, sustainable food-security and mutual-aid model for Midland Commons. Led by Rising Tide Ministries in partnership with community volunteers, this project combines raised-bed food production, habitat restoration, and mutual-aid pantry services to reduce food insecurity and increase ecological resilience in Southeast Portland.¹

Funding will support materials, volunteer training, and infrastructure for the first three development phases (2025 – 2026), including habitat certification, pantry facility upgrades, and education programs for local residents.

### PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Pantry Planning Project develops the Midland Pantry as a dual-purpose resource: a community food distribution hub and a living demonstration of urban agro-ecology.

**Core Objectives**  
1. Provide fresh produce free of charge to local residents through raised-bed gardening and mutual-aid distribution.  
2. Establish a certified food forest and wildlife habitat in consultation with Indigenous experts.  
3. Promote community health, accessibility, and environmental education.  
4. Document and publish all processes for replication in other Oregon communities.

### COORDINATION STRUCTURE
