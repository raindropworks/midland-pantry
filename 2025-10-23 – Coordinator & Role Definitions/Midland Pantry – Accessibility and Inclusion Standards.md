### SUMMARY

This document defines the accessibility and inclusion practices used across all phases of the Midland Pantry & Community Food Forest initiative.  
It supports equitable participation by individuals with disabilities, chronic health conditions, and neurodivergent volunteers or coordinators.

### GUIDING PRINCIPLES

- All project areas, documents, and workshops will be designed to meet or exceed ADA accessibility standards.
- Physical participation will always be optional; administrative and planning contributions are equally valued.
- Neurodivergent and disabled collaborators receive role flexibility and pacing accommodations.
- All communication materials will use plain language and readable fonts.

### ACCESSIBLE DESIGN

- Pathways ≥ 36 inches wide with solid, non-slip surfaces.
- Raised-bed heights adjustable from 18–30 inches for mobility access.
- Clear visual signage with large-print or Braille options.
- Quiet and shaded rest zones for sensory regulation.
- Digital content accessible via screen readers and captioned videos.

### INCLUSIVE COMMUNICATION

- Provide written agendas, meeting summaries, and asynchronous discussion options.
- Maintain trauma-informed and disability-inclusive volunteer environments.
- Ensure that feedback channels are open, anonymous if needed, and acted upon.

### TRAINING & ACCOUNTABILITY

- All volunteers receive an accessibility orientation during onboarding.
- Coordinators perform quarterly accessibility audits of both site and materials.
- Feedback outcomes documented in “Project Metadata/Accessibility Review Logs.”
